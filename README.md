# Machine Learing Utilities

This package is a collection of my code snippets to make my learning journey of ML/DL becomes easier. Much of the code snippets here are inspired by D2L. I created this repository to implement things my way while learning from the D2L book, in an attempt to not to use the `d2l` package which the book uses. It avoids me writing all the boilerplate code myself. Feel free to copy or take inspiration from it.

**NOTE**: *It is not a full-fledged production grade library. So, use it at your own risk.*
