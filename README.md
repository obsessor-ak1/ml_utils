# Machine Learing Utilities

This package is a collection of my code snippets to make my learning journey of ML/DL becomes easier. It avoids me writing all the boilerplate code myself. Feel free to copy or take inspiration from it.

**NOTE**: *It is not a full-fledged production grade library. So, use it at your own risk.*
